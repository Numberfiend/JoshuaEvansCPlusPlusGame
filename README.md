<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
#  Cybernetic

<!-- A screenshot of your game would be nice here... -->
The job is simple. Take out the robots in the area. That should be enough to pay back your debt. But please be careful because one hit from them will end your life in return. You can see your heart on your heads up display...but if you're dead well I guess you won't

Features:
* Player can move around the area and not leave the boundaries of the screen
* Player can shoot every 2 seconds upon first firing
* When shooting you can hear a sound effect when you do
* A tilemap is used in the game loaded from an external text file
* Enemies spawn at random locations on the screen every time you play the game
* Background music over the whole game
* A score at the top left to keep track (need to get to 5)
* A heart in the middle of your screen so that you can keep track of health as well as a numerical value in the top left.

## Dependencies
